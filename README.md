It's an effective way to enhance your productivity and maintain concentration.

## Features

- Automatic cycling between WORK and REST periods.
- Customizable timer durations with two sliders.
- Settings are saved in your local storage.
- Beautiful visual representation: A bottle filled with tomato juice that empties during intervals and turns green during breaks.
- Intuitive and user-friendly design.
